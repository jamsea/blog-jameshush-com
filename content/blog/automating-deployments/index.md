Automating deployments is the first thing I do whenever I join any new company.

Even before my main focus was DevOps

# Make a checklist

Do _not_ start by installing $SHINY_NEW_ORCHESTRATION_TOOL, we have to learn to walk before we can run. People love to try to work out the "optimal" solution that will take months instead of going for the small next step. Especially if you're new to the team, you're not going to have the social capital to get buy in for a long winded new project. What can you do instead?

Create a checklist in the README file at the root of the repo you're working on.

Not only will this help any new team mate deploy, but frankly, it'll help _you_ remember the steps. Also, you'll need these steps written down _anyway_ in order to figure out what to automate next when you do get around to installing $SHINY_NEW_ORCHESTRATION_TOOL.

Here's an example of what the section in the README.md file will look like:

```md
# Deploying the website to production

[] Tag @everyone in #engineering on slack with the message "Starting deploy now ðŸš€"
[] Go to https://www.example.com/location/to/get/api?key and copy your API key.
[] Add the line `export SOME_API_KEY="$API_KEY_YOU_COPIED_ABOVE"` to ~/.zshrc on your computer.
[] Run `npm run custom-build-script`
[] Run `zip -r foo.zip dist/website/foo`
[] Run North America upload script by typing `./scripts/upload_zip_to_prod.sh`
[] Run EU upload script by typing `./scripts/upload_zip_to_eu.sh`
[] Go to https://www.example.com/status and make sure it doesn't say 'error'.
[] Go to https://www.example.com and hard reload on Firefox to make sure it works.
[] Tag @everyone in #engineering on slack with these check boxes checked.
```

Notice, we have _not_ changed _any_ of the steps. We've merely written them down. If you're like most engineers, your spidey senses are tingling. "Why don't we combine `upload_zip_to_prod.sh` with `upload_zip_to_eu.sh` right now! It'll only take five minutes!" **Stop**. The goal is _assemble_ the steps into one place **first**. We want to get a win within the first day.

# Make a shell script

```bash
# Prompt the user to go to a website if their API key isn't set.
if [[ ! -v SOME_API_KEY ]]; then
    echo "SOME_API_KEY is not set."
    echo "Go to https://www.example.com/location/to/get/api?key, copy your API key and paste it below:"
    read SOME_API_KEY
    export SOME_API_KEY=$SOME_API_KEY
fi

# Easy to automate commands
npm run custom-build-script
zip -r foo.zip dist/website/foo
./scripts/upload_zip_to_prod.sh
./scripts/upload_zip_to_eu.sh

# Harder to automate commands
cat << EOF
ðŸŽ‰ Website deployed! Here are the next steps:
 [] Go to https://www.example.com/status and make sure it doesn't say 'error'.
 [] Go to https://www.example.com and hard reload on Firefox to make sure it works.
 [] Tag @everyone in #engineering on slack with these check boxes checked.
EOF
```

# Add it to Github actions or Jenkins

If you do not have any CI/CD tool setup, and you're already using Github, I recommend using Github actions. In the short term, yes, you do have to worry about Github actions going down, but that can be handled later by setting up your own custom Github Actions runners. If the action _does_ go down while you're setting things up, you can always run the action from your own computer using [act](https://github.com/nektos/act) if you're in a pinch.

Here's an example of a simple Github Action I use to deploy [www.jameshush.com](https://www.jameshush.com/) every time there's a push to the `main` branch:

GITHUB-EMBED https://github.com/jamsea/jameshush.com/blob/fac952f7872e1513177b06061b4e06108ddb8c6a/.github/workflows/main.yml#L11-L20 yaml 11-20 GITHUB-EMBED

However, if you have a separate Ops/Infrastructure/DevOps team who like things done a certain way, work _with_ them not _against_ them to help you get this setup.
Remember your end goal is to automate deploys, not to introduce new tech for the sake of it.

# Reinvest your new found time

Here are some ideas:

- Add the (Slack Notify)[https://github.com/marketplace/actions/slack-notify] step to your new Github action to remove the manual update step.
- Create a simple end to end test to replace your manual smoke test of "hard reloading on Firefox". Bonus points if you make it work in mobile Safari too!
- Setup something like (Semantic Releases)[https://github.com/semantic-release/release-notes-generator] to automatically generate release notes.

The list goes on. The point is, each of these are their own separate tasks, with their own separate tickets and pull requests.

# Action items

1. Make a check list of your current deploy process, create a PR, and post it for your coworkers _today_. If there's some steps you're missing, reach out to people on your team and ask about them in the pull request itself.

2. By the end of the week, convert this check list into a shell script. Remember, use `echo` to prompt users to manually execute steps for any step you can't automate by the end of the week.

3. By the end of next week, migrate your script to a job runner like Github Actions or Jenkins.

Email me your checklist once you finish it! I'd love to see it. Until then I'll se
