David started Superstruct to build a repeatable system for finding, recruiting, vetting, onboarding, and managing talented software engineers. This system integrates over 10 years of software engineering management experience with deep technical knowledge to help companies clear milestones faster, cheaper, and with less risk.

David has led teams of engineers to ship projects like ultra-high-scale ad servers handling over 10 billion requests per day, online learning systems, white-label performance marketing SAAS platforms, and Project Matterhorn, the system that would eventually becomeÂ [Disney.com](http://disney.com/).
